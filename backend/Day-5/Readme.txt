console IO
___________

console.input   --   program obtains values to variables during the runtime from user

Scanner class   



--  sc.nextInt();
    sc.next();
    sc.nextDouble();


importing the particular class fully qualified.

ex: import java.util.*;          -> not a best practice

    import java.util.Scanner;    -> correct

( by using * , there is no increase in the file size but not clarifybale about the class we are importing when there are multuiple imports from different packages like 
    import java.io.Date;
    import java.sql.Date;
    
)
