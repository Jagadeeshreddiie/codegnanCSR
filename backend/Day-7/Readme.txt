Array :

    Collection (finite set) of similar type elements/values.    

    A collection (finite set) of homogenous elements.

    A collection (finite set) of like typed elements.

        with same name and different index, An index is an Integer value starts with '0' and ends with 'size-1'


Working with Array :

    Declare -> Array Ref. Variable.

        syn : type [] var;
              type var [];

        !!!  Difference of using [] before and after var is !!!
                type [] var -> we can give more than vars... as type[] var;
                type var [] -> we can give only one var.

    Define -> Initialize the Array.

        Eg: new type[ int size ];

    * there is no name for arrays, We can access using referencial variables only.
