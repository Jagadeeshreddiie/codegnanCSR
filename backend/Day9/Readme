Set of specifications to a group of classes.
    -> says the class what to do but not how to do.

interface ref. variables can be instantiated with the class that implement the interface.


    -> int. ref. var. can only call interface methods but not "non interface nethods".

    end advantage -- 
                    app. will not use or don't use non-interface methods. 
                    portability

                    the app. is not "specific" to implementation but it is implementation portable.
                    car a=new Slavia();
                    car b=new Fortuner();
                    ->[ App. can be ported from one implementation to another implementation without any change.]

    "LOOSELY COPOULED ARCHITECTURE".

EXAMPLE

person -- class

    -id
    -name
    -email
    +setter
    +getter
    +constructors
    +toString

personService  -- interface

    +find person int(id)
    +savePerson(person p)
